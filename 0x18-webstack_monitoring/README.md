## 0x18. Webstack monitoring
<p>In this project I will be perfoming web monitoring using DataDog
The Web stack monitoring will done into 2 categories:
<ul>
<li> Application monitoring: getting data about your running software and making sure it is behaving as expected</li>
<li> Server monitoring: getting data about your virtual or physical server and making sure they are not
overloaded (could be CPU, memory, disk or network overload)</li>
</ul>
</p>
