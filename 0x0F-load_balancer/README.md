<h1> 0x0F. Load balancer </h1>

# Concept of Load balancing
<p>When you have an enterprise application or website that gets lot of hits,
your server might be under heavy load. In that case, you may want to consider
distributing the load across multiple servers. </p>

<p> A Load balancer will distribute the work-load of your system to multiple
individual systems, or group of systems to to reduce the amount of load on an
individual system, which in turn increases the reliability, efficiency and
availability of your enterprise application or website. </p>
