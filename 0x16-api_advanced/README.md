## 0x16. API advanced

<p> In this project, I will be learning advanced API techniques. I will be learning how to do the following</p>
<b> * How to read API documentation to find the endpoints youâ€™re looking for </b>
<b> * How to use an API with pagination </b>
<b> * How to parse JSON results from an API </b>
<b> * How to make a recursive API call </b>
<b> * How to sort a dictionary by value </b>

<p> I will be using the reddit API to experiment all of the above task </p>
